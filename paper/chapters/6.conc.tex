\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
We present a model reduction routine that combines the classic model reduction method, defined with respect to a weighted inner product, with symplectic model reduction. This allows the reduced system to be defined with respect to the norms and inner-products that are natural to the problem. Furthermore, the symplectic nature of the reduced system preserves the Hamiltonian structure of the original system, which results in robustness and enhanced stability in the reduced system.

We demonstrate that including the weighted inner-product in the symplectic model reduction can be viewed as a natural extension of the unweighted symplectic method. Therefore, the stability preserving properties of the symplectic method generalize naturally to the new method.

Numerical results suggest that classic model reduction methods with respect to a weighted inner product can help with the boundedness of the system. However, only the symplectic treatment can consistently increase the accuracy of the reduced system. This is consistent with the fact the symplectic methods preserve the Hamiltonian structure.

We also show that to accelerate the evaluation of the nonlinear terms, adopting a symplectic approach is essential. This allows an accurate reduced model that is consistently enhanced when the basis for the nonlinear term is enriched.

Hence, the symplectic model-reduction with respect to a weighted inner product can provide an accurate and robust reduced system that allows the use of the norms and inner products most appropriate to the problem.
