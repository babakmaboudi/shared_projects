In the recent years, a considerable attention has been geared toward preserving structures and invariants in reduced basis methods, to enhance the stability and the robustness of the reduced system. In the context of Hamiltonian systems, symplectic model reduction is an approach that tends to construct a reduced order system that preserve the symplectic symmetry of Hamiltonian systems. However, the symplectic methods are based on the standard Euclidean inner products and are not suitable for problems that are equipped with a more general inner product. In this paper we generalize the symplectic model reduction method such that it can adapt to the norms and the inner products most appropriate to the problem while preserving the symplectic symmetry of Hamiltonian systems. To construct a reduced basis and accelerate evaluation of nonlinear terms, a greedy generation of a symplectic basis is proposed. Furthermore, it is shown that the greedy approach yields a norm bounded reduced basis. The efficiency, accuracy, and stability of this model reduction technique is illustrated through the simulations of a vibrating elastic beam and the sine-Gordon equation.
